description: Verify Pokemon Unbound hybrid injection safety. Use when asked to inject a translated ROM, inspect relocation/free-space behavior, debug corrupted ROM output, check pointer updates, map output, fixed-size overflow, or in-place versus relocated writes.

# Unbound Injection QA

Run injection only on controlfixed JSON.

## Workflow

```bash
./005_hybrid_injector.py rom/unbound.gba out/unbound-texts-it-controlfix.json -o out/unbound-translated.gba --map-output out/hybrid-map.json
```

For experiments, write ROM/map outputs to `/tmp`.

## Checks

Inspect map/report data for relocated count, in-place count, skipped entries, free-space use, overlapping writes, and entries that could not fit. Pointer-based longer text may relocate; fixed-size non-pointer text needs shorter translations or new pointer coverage.

Preserve the source ROM. Do not run destructive git or file cleanup commands without explicit request.
